# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# How to Install

## Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download them from https://nodejs.org/.
node v v20.5.0
npm v 10.2.3


## Step 2: Install the app and Dependencies
``` bash
cd <supabase-cards>
npx install

```
This will create a new React project using Vite as the build tool and install dependencies.


## Step 3: Run the Application
#### Run your React application using

``` bash
npx run dev

```
